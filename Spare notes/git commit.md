**git commit** - Committing a snapshot to the project history. A **snapshot** means the state of our project in any given time, including all of the files and directories in it

	$ git commit
	[master (root-commit) 6357c8d] First commit - Create index page
	 1 file changed, 15 insertions(+)
	 create mode 100644 index.html
	 
Then we enter a meaningful message in the present tense, such as "Create index page".

Committed snapshots are "**safe**" versions of a project, i.e. they will never be changed.

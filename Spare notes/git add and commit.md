We know that there are [[The Three Trees]] in Git - 1. The **repository**, 2. The **staging index** and 3. The **working directory**.

The basic workflow is this. If you have a file called "file.txt", this exists in your working directory. To stage it, use `git add file.txt`. Then to move it from the staging index to the repository, use `git commit -m "Add file.txt"`.
